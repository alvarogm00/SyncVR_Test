SyncVR Skills Test

This app is intended to simulate a VR app by substituting the head movements with mouse movements. I have chosen to simulate the app instead of compiling an actual VR app simply because I do not know which VR devices are at your disposal. In order to port this app to any VR device, it will only be needed to substitute de mouse control for head movement control.

Since the app is intended to be used during a medical procedure, I assumed the patient will be in a seated or lying down position, meaning they wouldn’t be able to look around 360º.

Instructions

The game is played by simply looking around with the mouse. 
On the main menu, look directly for a few seconds to each button to press it. 
On the game scene, look at the drone for a few seconds in order to begin controlling it. Once it is under your control, you can move it around by looking around the environment. 

The goal is to build a robot to your liking. To do so, you will have to pick up the shapes on the left with the drone’s magnet and put them on the matching shape on the right. The first shape you choose will select the robot’s head, the second one will select the robot’s chest and the third one will select the robot’s legs. 

To open the pause menu, simply look straight up or down for a few seconds. 

Design

The goal of this app is to help patients distract themselves during painful medical procedures mainly focused towards children. 
It is designed to distract the patient from the pain by stimulating creativity. Right now there are only three options for each robot limb, but a final product should have a wider variety of options. Since it is aimed towards children, in order to distract the child from the painful procedure it presents them with a simple shape-based and color-based puzzle. The simple puzzle is intended to focus the child’s mind away from the painful procedure and onto a task that will also help them develop their motor and cognitive skills. 

I have chosen for the goal to be building robots first, because toy robots are a very popular kind of toy, so I assumed a majority of children are already familiarized with them, and also enjoy them. 

Second, because robots are very versatile and offer a lot of room for creativity when it comes to designing and modelling new parts to update the game. 
Third, I have chosen to make this a puzzle and building game because, since it is aimed towards children undergoing a painful procedure, I do not think it should have a game over, or fail / death state. The game should not punish the player for failing or doing something wrong, instead it should always give a rewarding feeling in order to counter the unpleasant feelings the patient is probably undergoing while playing the game. 

The current look of the app is a bit far for its final intended look. Since it is aimed for children, the robots and environment will be cartoony and bright colored. 
Also, the environment would be much richer and bigger, with the robot parts scattered around it, so the patient has to look for them a little. Finally, every robot created would be added to environment, and maybe the patient would be able to also interact with them a bit after creating them.
